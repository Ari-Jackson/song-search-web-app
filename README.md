# Song Search Web App

This is a song search web app project done for the 9.3 Pusuit fellowship, Module 2 portfolio project. The live site can be found [here](https://music-search-proj.netlify.app/).

My app uses [Spotify Music's Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) to allow you to search through thousands of songs in the spotify song library and easily get access to data about that search result.
